HXRefactored is a revolutionary conference that focuses on improving health experiences through technology and design. Gathering more than 600 cross-disciplinary thinkers and practitioners and through an inspired mix of thought-provoking talks, workshops, and discussions, HxRefactored applies design, science, evidence, and theory to re-imagine the entire health journey, and find new ways to
actually deliver that vision.
