GIANT exists because creativity and community go together like a guitar and amp.
GIANT is an event for people who do rad work. We'll talk about rad work at a technical level,
and music and just a generally good time. We'll have people talking about rad work who you've
heard of, and people you haven't heard of. That's because we think inspiration comes from all
over, and rad work happens in all kinds of professions.
