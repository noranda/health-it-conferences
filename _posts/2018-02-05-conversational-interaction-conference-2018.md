As connections with customers and application users cover more features, options, and deliver more information, the classical visual user interface has become increasingly difficult to use. With natural language interaction—through speech or text—a user simply types or says what they want. It may be a one-time request or a conversation, but dealing with digital systems in human language is the way of the future. The technology is here now, and continually improving, with increasingly effective tools that allow developing conversational interaction without a research project!
