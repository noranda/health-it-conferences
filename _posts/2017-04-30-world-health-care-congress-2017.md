The 14th Annual World Health Care Congress convenes decision makers from all sectors of health care to catalyze meaningful partnerships and change. In 2017, faculty focus on the impact of mega-mergers and consolidation, navigating ACA implementation, consumer engagement, the shift from FFS to value-based payment, and scalable, innovative care models and technologies that show promise in reducing cost and increasing quality.
