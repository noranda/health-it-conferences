At TRANSFORM 2016 we will engage with the world’s top thinkers to boldly envision a sustainable future for health. We will address the dynamics of social, political, scientific, technological and economic sectors; explore how people make change happen – and examine how leadership, culture and collaboration make it possible.

We will investigate the future of a new ecosystem created by individuals and organizations responding to real, and oftentimes personal, needs.
