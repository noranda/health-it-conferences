Pharmaceutical and biotech companies all believe in representing the patient voice within the company. The challenge is how to make patient centricity an actuality within your organization. The paradigm shift in the healthcare industry to have a greater focus on the patient voice has created a need for industry organizations to ramp up their patient advocacy efforts to more successfully engage and empower what is most important; the patient. This summit brings together manufacturer and advocacy professionals to discuss how to most effectively engage the patient in drug development, how to create successful partnerships, and discusses strategies and results from successful case examples.
