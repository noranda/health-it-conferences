This meeting has a vibrant and diverse community of ambitious and excited scientists, and offers a supportive environment that encourages new ideas to change the research and practice of medicine.

Health and healthcare are contributing many new sources of data to this deluge, including electronic medical records, insurance claims, mobile health, social media and environmental health. These transformative phenomena require new scientific perspectives, theories and methods to make sense of data, inform policy decisions and take appropriate action. These challenges can be met only by combining methods from multiple fields, including informatics, computer science, statistics and epidemiology.

Implementation informatics moves theory into practice, concepts into reality. This allows us to geek out on data and programming while seeing the translational outcomes within a short time.
