This weekend long event brings together clinicians, data scientists and innovators
in healthcare to address current problems in intensive care. The datathon focuses on
the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC) II database â€“ a
large database of over 40,000 patients which contains rich information about those
admitted to the intensive care unit at the Beth Israel Deaconnes Medical Centre in
the last decade. Using the MIMIC-II critical care database, participants will form
teams to work together on publishable research studies.
