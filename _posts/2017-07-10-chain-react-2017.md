A two day, one-track React Native conference hosted in Portland, Oregon. Join us at the beautiful Armory in downtown Portland this summer! Chain React: The React Native Conference will be comprised of multiple talks on React Native given by mobile software engineers at Facebook, AirBnB, and others, on a variety of topics from beginner to expert level. Weâ€™re expecting a few hundred attendees and are working hard to put on a great conference.
