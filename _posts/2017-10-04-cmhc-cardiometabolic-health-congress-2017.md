As the largest multidisciplinary conference of its kind, CMHC provides a unique opportunity to learn the latest scientific and clinical developments in the overlapping areas of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Our initial lineup of sessions and expert speakers covers an array of topics within the field of cardiometabolic disease. This year's agenda will feature our most inspiring and thought-provoking program to-date, as we explore the various facets of cardiovascular disease and its diagnosis, treatment, management, and ultimately prevention.
