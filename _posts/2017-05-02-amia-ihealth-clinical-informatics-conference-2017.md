iHealth is where clinicians, informatics professionals and other interested parties convene, share, and learn about improving team-based, integrated health care driven by data and evidence to impact outcomes for patients, families, and communities. Covering a spectrum of issues - from developing and incorporating patient engagement strategies, to analyzing population health data, to using innovative mHealth solutions - the goal of AMIA's iHealth 2017 Clinical Informatics Conference is to provide a forum for both evidence and experience-based clinical informatics that will contribute to improvements in health and health care.
