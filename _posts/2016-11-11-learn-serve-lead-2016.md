Learn Serve Lead—open to all those who care about the future of academic medicine—is the only meeting where our community converges present and expands the future potentials of medical schools and teaching hospitals. By bringing together our community from across campuses, across disciplines, and across missions, we can provide leadership, enable connections and deliver thought-provoking change that will transform health care.
