The Connected Health Symposium is an international change-agent conference that promotes
innovative thinking and the application of personal consumer health technologies to support
new models of care delivery. With a focus on trends at the intersection of technology and
new models of health care delivery, the Symposium convenes thought leaders in an effort to
grow the rapidly-expanding connected health marketplace. Our audience is a high-profile
gathering of innovators, researchers, C-level executives and policymakers who gather for
knowledge-sharing across the connected health landscape. Over 100 speakers and more than
1,000 attendees will come together to define the future of care delivery.
