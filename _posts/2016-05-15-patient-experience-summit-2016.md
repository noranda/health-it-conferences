The seventh annual Patient Experience Summit takes place May 15-18, 2016, at the Cleveland Convention Center in downtown Cleveland, Ohio.

The Patient Experience Summit brings together patient experience leaders, healthcare CEOs, innovators, nursing leaders, policy makers, major stakeholders and industry experts who are committed to not just the patient or caregiver experience, but also the human experience.

The theme of this year’s four-day, inter-professional conference is Caring Transformed: Anytime. Anywhere. and features expert speakers, panel discussions and workshops representing multiple healthcare professions and disciplines engaged in exploring innovative ways to create and sustain a human-centric environment. We’ll be talking about how patient experience is evolving from satisfaction surveys into a thread throughout quality, safety, access, and value. The future will be as much about how we design care experiences, as well as what we design.
