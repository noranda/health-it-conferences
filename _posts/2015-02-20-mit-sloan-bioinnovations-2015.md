Brings together industry, academic and policy leaders to discuss the most pressing issues
and exciting innovations in the healthcare sector. In the midst of a continually evolving
landscape, this year's BioInnovations Conference will focus on the concept of value in the
healthcare marketplace. With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, increasing advances
in science and the imminent transformation of the industry as a whole, opportunities abound.
We will engage in discussions with industry leaders who are redefining how value is created,
assessed and translated to improve healthcare practice.
