The unConference for women geeks of all kinds to share, connect, network, learn, inspire and have lots
of fun. We invite women working in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) to gather and connect.
Serving Geeky Women since 2007. While the unconference focuses on tech topics, this may be an opportunity
to also impart UX knowledge on others.
