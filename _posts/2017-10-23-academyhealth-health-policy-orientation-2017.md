Take a deep dive into all aspects of health policy at the 2017 Health Policy Orientation. Attendees will explore the many mechanisms of the policy process, including its key players (from relevant congressional staff to the three branches of government and federal agencies), an overview of the federal budget process, and insights into state health policy, public opinion, and more.
