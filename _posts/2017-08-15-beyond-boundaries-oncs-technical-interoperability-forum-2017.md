On August 15-16, 2017, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) will host a two-day, in-person only, technical interoperability forum with standards and technology industry stakeholders to: identify industry alignment around priority interoperability use cases, gain insight into current and expected interoperability challenges, including information blocking, and better understand next steps that respective stakeholders can take individually and collectively to improve interoperability among health IT systems.
