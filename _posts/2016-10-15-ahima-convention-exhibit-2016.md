The need for reliable and secure health information has become increasingly more important as healthcare organizations continue to face and grapple with some of the biggest changes in the industry and as patient engagement becomes more critical. The 88th AHIMA Convention and Exhibit, October 15â€“19, 2016, in Baltimore, MD, will explore the many ways in which health information professionals must persistently think big to launch our future and the future or our organizations.
