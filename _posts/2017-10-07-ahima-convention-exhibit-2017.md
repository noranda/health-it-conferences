The healthcare industry is balancing the need to provide quality care while reducing costs and managing population health. To do this effectively, healthcare organizations are becoming more reliant on the optimal gathering, analysis, and use of health information. The 89th AHIMA Convention and Exhibit, October 7â€’11, 2017, in Los Angeles, CA, will explore the many ways health information professionals must inspire, innovate and lead their organizations into the future of health data analytics, informatics, and information governance.
