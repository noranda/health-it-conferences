This year we will present a strategic long-term vision of the massively growing importance of data in healthcare and the emphasize the importance of accelerating the pace of clinical, operational, and financial outcomes. We will look at other industries that are rapidly adopting comprehensive digital strategies and the implications for the digitization of healthcare.  We will examine how digitization drives a paradigm shift in which patient data outside the healthcare system becomes a mission-critical function for successful value-based models.  All of this will paint a picture where data and analytics become a central and strategic function for healthcare organizations of all sizes. Then we’ll share many new innovations from leading data-driven healthcare organizations.  We will have nationally known keynote speakers, 30 educational, case study, and technical breakout session sessions, and 24 new Analytics Walkabout hands-on stations for individual interaction. Machine learning will be featured frequently as an important upcoming trend in healthcare.  We will have new networking opportunities to allow you to meet others with similar topical interests.  And of course, we will continue with having fun, interactive “ah-ha” experiences supplemented by our updated HAS event app with interactive questions and real-time polling, session analytics, prizes and awards.
