In the midst of a continually evolving landscape, this year's Healthcare and BioInnovations Conference will focus on the concept of value in the healthcare marketplace. With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, increasing advances in science and the imminent transformation of the industry as a whole, opportunities abound. We will engage in discussions with industry leaders who are redefining how value is created, assessed and translated to improve healthcare practice.
