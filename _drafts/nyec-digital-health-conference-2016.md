The 2016 Digital Health Conference (DHC) will bring together 500 senior-level healthcare professionals to learn about cutting-edge innovations and foster dynamic conversation addressing how healthcare is being redefined through technology.  From luminary keynotes to provocative fireside chats and TEDMED style presentations, the DHC features a diverse roster of thought-leading, incisive speakers from across the healthcare spectrum.   Each year a who’s who of New York’s healthcare and health tech community gather for two days of networking, lively intellectual exchange, and exploration to see what’s new, what’s cutting edge, and what will shape the future of healthcare.
