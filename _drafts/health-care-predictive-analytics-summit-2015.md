The health care industry has access to more data about its customers than almost any other industry, yet the data is often underutilized. The Health Care Predictive Analytics Summit brings together hospitals, health systems, and health plans to discuss actionable items to efficiently access, share, and analyze data to meet important business objectives. Hear valuable insight from thought leaders in the industry on how to use predictive analytics to improve the health of populations, identify gaps in case, detect high risk populations, reduce readmissions, and promote high quality, cost-effective care.
