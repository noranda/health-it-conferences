This is your invitation to join us at the UX Strategies Summit for three days of stories both insightful and transformational.
Stories from companies that are working through on-the-ground challenges in executing a UX strategy. Defining UX roadmaps, steering a product vision through completion, implementing UX strategy across various business units, aligning UX with brand and core business values; it’s a daunting, uphill battle. We can help you with that. We’ve built a brilliant community of speakers eager to meet and have conversations with you - real, candid talks that will arm you with practical solutions you’ll be able to implement back in the office. No fluff.
